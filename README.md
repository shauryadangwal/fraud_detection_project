# fraud_detection_project
The project gives an overview of fraud detection that are done in credit card transaction. It is necessary for the owner and the for the company from whose gateway payment is being done.

Supervised learning techniques are widely employed in credit card fraud detection, as they make use of the assumption that fraudulent patterns can be learned from an analysis of past transactions. The task becomes challenging, however, when it has to take account of changes in customer behavior and fraudstersâ€™ ability to invent novel fraud patterns. In this context, unsupervised learning techniques can help the fraud detection systems to find anomalies. In this project unsupervised learning is applied. Unsupervised techniques improve the fraud detection accuracy. Unsupervised outlier scores, computed at different levels of granularity, are compared and tested on a real, annotated, credit card fraud detection dataset.
